### Writing Code

The <a href="https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm" title="Client relationship software" target="_blank">Django-CRM project</a> aims to deliver high-level CRM software while keeping it easy to customize, develop, and maintain.  
To achieve this, it follows a key principle: leverage Django's built-in capabilities whenever possible.  
There are at least two good reasons to do so:

- Developers familiar with Django framework will find the CRM code understandable.
- Developers new to Django will benefit from Django's excellent documentation.

We are focused on improving the functionality that has already been created. 
Making it more convenient and understandable for a wide audience of users.  
But now we are also ready to add new features.

- It's easier to start by working with issues marked with a <a href="https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm/labels/good%20first%20issue" target="_blank">“good first issue”</a> label. They are supplied with instructions.
- Create a draft PR when starting work on bigger changes for discussion and assistance.
- Please see [Task-board & roadmap](https://github.com/users/DjangoCRM/projects/1) for more information.
