### Writing Code

The Django-CRM project aims to deliver high-level CRM software while keeping it easy to customize, develop, and maintain.  
To achieve this, it follows a key principle: leverage Django's built-in capabilities whenever possible.

We are focused on improving the functionality that has already been created. 
Making it more convenient and understandable for a wide audience of users.  
But now we are ready to add new features. 

- It's easier to start by working with issues marked with a <a href="https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm/labels/good%20first%20issue" target="_blank">“good first issue”</a> label. They are supplied with instructions.
